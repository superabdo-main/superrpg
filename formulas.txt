Basic Attack:

    Player chooses to attack.
    Calculate damage: Damage = Player_ATK - Enemy_DEF
    Subtract damage from enemy's HP.
    Output result: "You attacked the enemy for 10 damage!"

Defend:

    Player chooses to defend.
    For that turn, reduce incoming damage by a certain percentage (e.g., 50%).
    Example: Incoming_Damage = Enemy_ATK - (Player_DEF * 1.5)
    Increasing the mana

Use Ability/Spell:

    Player chooses a spell or ability.
    Check if the player has enough MP to use it.
    Calculate damage (if it's an offensive spell) or heal (if it's a healing spell).
    Example formula for a fire spell: Fire_Damage = Player_MATK - Enemy_MDEF
    Output result: "You cast Fireball and dealt 15 damage!"

Use Item:

    Player chooses an item (e.g., health potion, mana potion).
    Apply the effect (restore HP, restore MP, etc.).
    Example: "You used a health potion and restored 20 HP!"

Run (optional):

    Player attempts to escape the battle.
    Random chance to succeed based on speed comparison (e.g., if Player_SPD > Enemy_SPD then the player escapes).
